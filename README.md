# RandomGameChallengeGenerator-RGCG-
A personal project that originated from the boredom of two high school students

## Introduction
This is my first project and I have no idea how building works and what dependencies are in building. I wanted to at least dip my feet into the water and learn more about open source projects. I am open to suggestions and would love opinions and help. So far, I don't know exactly what and how I want this program to work, but I will develop the idea as I go. Again, please make any suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/mrbeezwax/RandomGameChallengeGenerator-RGCG-/issues) section.

## About the project
A random generator that will read a user's list of Steam library and upon request, generate a random challenge for a random game from the library. The user can also add non-steam games to the list. The challenges will be community-created and completed challenges will be shown on a user's profile.

## Possible Features
* A difficulty rating for challenges
* Reading games from other known game hubs (Battle.net, Origin, etc.)
* Some incentive to complete the challenge
* Create a mobile version

I will look at other suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/mrbeezwax/RandomGameChallengeGenerator-RGCG-/issues) section. All changes will be included in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
